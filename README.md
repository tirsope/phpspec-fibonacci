###### PHP Kata: Fibonacci sequence with PHPSpec #####

This is my practice kata for Fibonacci serie written in PHP and using PHPSpec.

From Wikipedia:

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers or Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following integer sequence:

1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144, ....
or (often, in modern usage):

0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144, ....

The Fibonacci spiral: an approximation of the golden spiral created by drawing circular arcs connecting the opposite corners of squares in the Fibonacci tiling; this one uses squares of sizes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.
By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2),
with seed values

F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1
or

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1.
